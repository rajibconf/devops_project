<h1>🗃️ Nginx Proxy Manager to put SSL on everything</h1>
<p>One of the best projects you can spin up is Nginx Proxy Manager. My recommendation for those that are getting into home labs is to start with Nginx Proxy Manager as it provides a simple GUI to manage your Docker container SSL certificates for your containers and easily lets you provision Lets Encrypt certs. Having SSL certs on your containers with web interfaces just makes everything more secure and work better with other solutions that may not deal well with self-signed certificates.</p>
